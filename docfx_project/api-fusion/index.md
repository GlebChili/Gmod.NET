# GmodDotNet API Documentation
GmodDotNet consists of two main components: [GmodNET.API package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GmodNET.API/), a .NET library which contains methods, types, and interfaces needed for writing Garry's Mod modules, and core GmodDotNet runtime, which supports, manages, and loads .NET modules directly into the game process.

Thus GmodDotNet documentation covers two public API layers:

1) [Docs for GmodNET.API](/api/GmodNET.API.html) .NET library.

2) [Docs for dotnet Lua library](/lua-api/dotnet.html) exposed by the core GmodDotNet runtime to manage modules (load and unload them).
